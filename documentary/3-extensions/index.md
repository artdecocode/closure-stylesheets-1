## CSS Extensions

Internally at Google, Closure Stylesheets are frequently referred to as "Google
Stylesheets" or "GSS", so you will see references to GSS in the
[source code](https://github.com/google/closure-stylesheets). Some
developers prefer to be explicit about which files use the Closure Stylesheets
extensions to CSS by using a **`.gss`** file extension.
